<p>Clipdinger manages a history of the system clipboard. It solves the problem that you often have to paste some text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but that has been replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.</p>

<p>If you want to paste some text that isn't in the clipboard any more, simply hit <em>SHIFT</em> + <em>ALT</em> + <em>V</em> to summon the Clipdinger window. Here you can select an entry with the <em>CursorUp/Down</em> keys and put it into the clipboard or auto-paste it by hitting <em>RETURN</em>.</p>

<p>After selecting a clip, you can also paste it to the online service <a href="http://sprunge.us">Sprunge.us</a> by hitting <em>ALT</em> + <em>P</em>. The returned URL for the clip is put into the clipboard for you to paste into your email or IRC channel etc.</p>

<p><em>ESCAPE</em>  or <em>ALT</em> + <em>W</em> aborts and minimizes the Clipdinger window.</p>

<h3>
<a id="history--favorites" class="anchor" href="#history--favorites" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History &amp; Favorites</h3>

<p>Clipdinger starts minimized, because it sits in the background and just monitors the system clipboard. When activated by pressing <em>SHIFT</em> + <em>ALT</em> + <em>V</em> its main window pops up:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger.png" alt="screenshot"></p>

<p>To the left is a history of your past clippings (empty, of course, when started for the first time). For easier orientation, the icon of the app that a clip was copied from is drawn to the left of the text. The top entry is always what's currently in the clipboard. Hover your mouse pointer over an entry for a tool tip with the time and date when a clip was added.</p>

<p>If you have the <em>Fade history entries over time</em> option activated, there'll also be a checkbox <em>Pause fading</em> below the history list. You find more on that farther down, where Clipdinger's settings are discussed.</p>

<p>To the right is a list of saved favorites. You right-click on an entry in the history to the left, and choose Add to favorites to make a clipping a favorite. The first 12 entries have automatically an <em>F-key</em> assigned for even quicker pasting of your most used clippings.</p>

<p>You can adjust the size of history/favorites by grabbing the dotted line between them. You can also completely collapse one of those lists. The <em>F-keys</em> will still work, even if your favorites are collapsed.</p>

<p>The <em>Move up</em> and <em>Move down</em> buttons allow for re-ordering the currently selected favorite.
<em>DEL</em> or choosing <em>Remove favorite</em> from the context menu eliminates an entry. <em>Edit title</em> let's you choose another title for it. By default, the contents of the clip is displayed, just like for the history list on the left.</p>

<p>You can quickly switch between history and favorites lists with <em>CursorRight/Left</em>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="clipboard-monitor" class="anchor" href="#clipboard-monitor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clipboard monitor</h3>

<p>You can open the <em>Clipboard monitor</em> from the <em>App</em> menu. It simply shows the current contents of theclipboard, which helps if you have to continuously switch between some clips from the history/favorites.
The Clipboard monitor is supposed be used as a replicant on the Desktop.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipboard-monitor.png" alt="screenshot"></p>

<p>Adjust the window size until it fits your needs, then drag the little handle onto the Desktop. Make sure the option to <em>Show replicants</em> in the Deskbar is active.</p>

<p>You can change the background by dropping a color onto it from any application, like e.g. Icon-O-Matic. Like the icon labels on the Desktop, the color of the text will toggle automatically between black and white according to the brightness of the dropped background color.</p>

<p>As a replicant the Clipboard monitor doesn't need a running Clipdinger to work. Double-clicking on the replicant will, however, summon Clipdinger by either launching it or simply unhiding its main window.</p>

<h3>
<a id="settings" class="anchor" href="#settings" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Settings</h3>

<p>This is the settings window, summoned with <em>Settings...</em> from the <em>App</em> menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger-settings.png" alt="screenshot"></p>

<p>At the top of the settings window, you can set the number of entries in the history (the default is 100).
Keep in mind that every clipping is kept in memory and if you copy many large blocks of text, you may clog up your memory. Though, for everyday use, where clippings are seldom larger than a few KiBs at most, having several dozen entries in the history shouldn't tax memory noticeably.</p>

<p>Once the limit of the history is reached, the oldest entry is removed automatically to make room for the new clipping.</p>

<p>You can remove an entry by selecting it and pressing <em>DEL</em> or choose <em>Remove clip</em> from the context menu. You remove the complete clipboard history with <em>Clear history</em> from the <em>History</em> menu.</p>

<p><em>Auto-start Clipdinger</em> controls if Clipdinger will be started automatically at every boot-up.</p>

<p><em>Auto-paste</em> will put the clipping you've chosen via double-click or <em>RETURN</em> into the window that was active before you have summoned Clipdinger.</p>

<p>The other settings belong to the fading feature: When the checkbox <em>Fade history entries over time</em> is active, entries get darker as time ticks on. You can set the intervall that entries are being tinted (<em>Delay</em>) and by how much they are tinted (<em>Steps</em>). The third slider sets the <em>Max. tint level</em>, i.e. how dark an entry can get.
Below the sliders is a summary of your setting in plain English.</p>

<p>If you leave your computer or just know that you won't do any copy&amp;paste for a longer time, you can simply check the <em>Pause fading</em> checkbox below the history list of the main window to prevent the entries in the history from fading. Note, that this checkbox is only visible if the fading option in the settings is active.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tips--tricks" class="anchor" href="#tips--tricks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>

<ul>
<li>  If you've used Clipdinger before v0.5.5, you can now remove the link to it in the <code>/boot/home/config/settings/boot/launch/</code> folder and use the new setting to auto-start instead.</li>
<li>  Changes in the settings window can be viewed live in the main window. To find the right fading settings for you, it's best to keep working normally for some time to fill the history and then just play around with the sliders until you're satisfied.</li>
<li>  Clipdinger's <em>Auto-paste</em> feature can be a bit tricky: It doesn't know in which window you pressed <em>SHIFT</em> + <em>ALT</em> + <em>V</em> for it to pop up. With activated auto-paste, it simply pastes into last window that was active before you hit <em>ENTER</em> or double-clicked an entry. So, avoid detours...</li>
<li>  If you want to back-up Clipdinger's settings, history or favorites, or have the need to delete one or all of these files, you'll find them under <code>/boot/home/config/settings/Clipdinger/</code>.</li>
<li>  If the replicant of the Clipboard monitor unexpectedly gives you grief (or any replicant for that matter), you can remove all replicants on the Desktop by deleting <code>/boot/home/config/settings/Tracker/tracker_shelf</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="thanks" class="anchor" href="#thanks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thanks</h3>

<p>I have to thank Werner Freytag who created ClipUp for BeOS which was my inspiration and motivation to work on Clipdinger, to have a similar tool that works as I expect it to under Haiku.
Even more thanks go to Rene Gollent, who pointed out many shortcomings in my amateurish code and provided solutions and patches.
Also, thanks to everyone that contributed translations for Clipdinger.</p>
