It solves the problem that you often have to paste some text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but that has been replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.\r\n\r\nIf you want to paste some text that isn't in the clipboard any more, simply hit _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ to summon the Clipdinger window. Here you can select an entry with the _CursorUp/Down_ keys and put it into the clipboard or auto-paste it by hitting _RETURN_.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a clip, you can also paste it to the online service [Sprunge.us](http://sprunge.us) by hitting _ALT_ + _P_. The returned URL for the clip is put into the clipboard for you to paste into your email or IRC channel etc.\r\n\r\n_ESCAPE_  or _ALT_ + _W_ aborts and minimizes the Clipdinger window.\r\n\r\n### History & Favorites\r\n\r\nClipdinger starts minimized, because it sits in the background a just monitors the system clipboard. When activated by pressing _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ its main window pops up:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger.png)\r\n\r\nTo the left is a history of your past clippings (empty, of course, when started for the first time). For easier orientation, the icon of the app that a clip was copied from is drawn to the left of the text. The top entry is always what's currently in the clipboard.\r\n\r\nIf you have the _Fade history entries over time_ option activated, there'll also be a checkbox _Pause fading_ below the history list. You find more on that farther down, where Clipdinger's settings are discussed.\r\n\r\nTo the right is a list of saved favorites. You right-click on an entry in the history to the left, and choose Add to favorites to make a clipping a favorite. The first 12 entries have automatically an _F-key_ assigned for even quicker pasting of your most used clippings.\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the size of history/favorites by grabbing the dotted line between them. You can also completely collapse one of those lists. The _F-keys_ will still work, even if your favorites are collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe _Move up_ and _Move down_ buttons allow for re-ordering the currently selected favorite.\r\n_DEL_ or choosing _Remove favorite_ from the context menu eliminates an entry. _Edit title_ let's you choose another title for it. By default, the contents of the clip is displayed, just like for the history list on the left.\r\n\r\nYou can quickly switch between history and favorites lists with _CursorRight/Left_.\r\n\r\n### Settings\r\n\r\nThis is the settings window, summoned with _Settings..._ from the _History_ menu:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger-settings.png)\r\n\r\nAt the top of the settings window, you can set the number of entries in the history (the default is 50).\r\nKeep in mind that every clipping is kept in memory and if you copy many large blocks of text, you may clog up your memory. Though, for everyday use, where clippings are seldom larger than a few KiBs at most, having a few dozen entries in the history shouldn't tax memory noticeably.\r\n\r\nOnce the limit of the history is reached, the oldest entry is removed automatically to make room for the new clipping.\r\n\r\nYou can remove an entry by selecting it and pressing _DEL_ or choose _Remove clip_ from the context menu. You remove the complete clipboard history with _Clear history_ from the _History_ menu.\r\n\r\n_Auto-paste_ will put the clipping you've chosen via double-click or _RETURN_ into the window that was active before you have summoned Clipdinger.\r\n\r\nThe other settings belong to the fading feature: When the checkbox _Fade history entries over time_ is active, entries get darker as time ticks on. You can set the intervall that entries are being tinted (_Delay_) and by how much they are tinted (_Steps_). The third slider sets the _Max. tint level_, i.e. how dark an entry can get.\r\nBelow the sliders is a summary of your setting in plain English.\r\n\r\nIf you leave your computer or just know that you won't do any copy&paste for a longer time, you can simply check the _Pause fading_ checkbox below the history list of the main window to prevent the entries in the history from fading. Note, that this checkbox is only visible if the fading option in the settings is active.\r\n\r\n### Tips & Tricks\r\n\r\n*   Obviously, Clipdinger can only keep a clipboard history while it's running. You should therefore create a link to it in the `/boot/home/config/settings/boot/launch/` folder. Then it gets started automatically on every boot-up.\r\n*   All changes in the settings window can be viewed live in the main window. To find the right fading settings for you, it's best to keep working normally for some time to fill the history and then just play around with the sliders until you're satisfied.\r\n*   Clipdinger's _Auto-paste_ feature can be a bit tricky: It doesn't know in which window you pressed _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ for it to pop up. With activated auto-paste, it simply pastes into last window that was active before you hit _ENTER_ or double-clicked an entry. So, avoid detours...\r\n*   If you want to back up Clipdinger's settings, history or favorites, or have the need to delete one or all of these files, you'll find them under `/boot/home/config/settings/Clipdinger/`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nClipdinger is directly available through HaikuDepot from the HaikuPorts repository.
